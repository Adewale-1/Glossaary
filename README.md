# Glossary

Glossary is a Java program that generates a glossary HTML page with links to definitions and terms, listed in a generated text file. The main page shows a list of all definitions, where each definition page has a return button to the home page. The program also hyperlinks any word/s that appear elsewhere in the glossary.
